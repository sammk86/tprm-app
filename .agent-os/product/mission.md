## The Problem

### Manual, Time-Consuming Vendor Assessment Processes

SMBs spend 2-3 weeks per vendor on manual risk assessments, leading to delayed vendor onboarding and increased operational costs. This results in 60% longer vendor onboarding cycles compared to enterprise solutions.

**Our Solution:** Automated assessment distribution and vendor self-service portal reduces assessment time by 70%.

### Lack of Standardized Risk Evaluation Frameworks

Without standardized frameworks, SMBs struggle with inconsistent risk evaluation, leading to 40% of vendors having incomplete or outdated risk profiles and increased compliance gaps.

**Our Solution:** Pre-built assessment templates with customizable questionnaires and automated risk scoring algorithms.

### Compliance Reporting Challenges and Audit Preparation

Manual compliance reporting leads to 35% accuracy issues and 2-3 weeks of preparation time for audits, resulting in potential regulatory violations and increased audit costs.

**Our Solution:** Automated compliance report generation with real-time dashboard monitoring and audit-ready documentation.

### Fragmented Tools and Processes Leading to Gaps in Oversight

SMBs use 5-7 different tools for vendor management, leading to data silos, missed risk indicators, and 25% of high-risk vendors going undetected.

**Our Solution:** Centralized platform integrating vendor management, risk assessment, monitoring, and reporting in one unified system.

## Differentiators

### SMB-Focused Design and Pricing

### Automated Risk Intelligence Integration

Unlike manual risk assessment tools, we provide automated integration with cybersecurity threat feeds, financial data providers, and news aggregation services. This results in real-time risk monitoring and 90% faster risk identification.
