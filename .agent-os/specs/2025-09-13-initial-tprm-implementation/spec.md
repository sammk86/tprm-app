# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Initial TPRM Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Implement the initial working version of the TPRM (Third-Party Risk Management) platform with core database models, user authentication, and basic vendor management functionality. This foundation will enable users to register, authenticate, and begin managing vendor profiles with essential risk assessment capabilities.

## User Stories

### User Registration and Authentication

As a compliance officer, I want to create an account and securely log into the TPRM platform, so that I can access vendor management and risk assessment features.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User visits the platform and clicks "Sign Up"
2. User provides email, password, company name, and role selection
3. System validates input and creates user account
4. User receives email verification link
5. User clicks verification link to activate account
6. User can now log in with email/password credentials
7. System redirects to appropriate dashboard based on user role

### Vendor Profile Management

As a procurement manager, I want to add and manage vendor profiles in the system, so that I can begin tracking vendor information and risk assessments.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User navigates to vendor management section
2. User clicks "Add New Vendor" button
3. User fills out vendor form with basic information (name, contact, services, etc.)
4. System validates and saves vendor profile
5. User can view, edit, and manage vendor profiles in a centralized list
6. User can categorize vendors by type and risk level
7. User can search and filter vendors by various criteria

### Basic Risk Assessment Setup

As a risk manager, I want to create and assign basic risk assessments to vendors, so that I can begin evaluating vendor risk levels.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User selects a vendor from the vendor list
2. User clicks "Create Assessment" for the selected vendor
3. User selects from pre-built assessment templates
4. System creates assessment instance and sends notification to vendor
5. User can track assessment progress and view results
6. System calculates basic risk scores based on responses

## Spec Scope

1. **User Authentication System** - Complete user registration, login, email verification, and role-based access control
2. **Database Schema Implementation** - Core database models for users, companies, vendors, and assessments using Prisma ORM
3. **Vendor Management Interface** - CRUD operations for vendor profiles with categorization and search functionality
4. **Basic Assessment Framework** - Assessment template system and basic risk scoring algorithm
5. **Dashboard and Navigation** - Role-based dashboards and navigation structure for different user types

## Out of Scope

- Advanced risk intelligence integrations
- JIRA integration
- Complex assessment workflows
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Mobile responsiveness optimization
- Email notification system (beyond basic verification)
- File upload and document management
- Advanced security features (MFA, SSO)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Authentication System** - Users can register, verify email, and log in with proper role-based access
2. **Functional Vendor Management** - Users can create, view, edit, and manage vendor profiles with search and filtering
3. **Basic Assessment Creation** - Users can create assessments for vendors and view basic risk scores
4. **Database Integration** - All data persists correctly in PostgreSQL with proper relationships and constraints
5. **Role-Based Navigation** - Different user types see appropriate dashboards and navigation options
